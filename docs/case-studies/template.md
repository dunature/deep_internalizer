### User Testimonial

> "Before using Deep Internalizer, I would skim through papers and forget most technical terms within days. Now, every word is anchored in its original context. I can recall specific definitions and their usage scenarios even weeks later. The X-Ray context feature is a game-changer — I no longer need to search for where I first encountered a term."
