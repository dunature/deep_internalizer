## User Testimonial

> "As a PM, I used to skim 50-page competitor analysis reports and forget everything by Monday. Deep Internalizer's semantic chunking helped me internalize the _core thesis_ instantly. Each chunk's summary acts as a mental anchor. Now, when discussing product strategy, I can cite specific frameworks and terminology accurately. It's like having a photographic memory for business concepts."
